Dose not working:
isEmpty();
removeBack();
removeFront();
addBack();


Reason:
isEmpty(): It always return a True no mater the list is empty or not
addBack():  The addBack() is same as the addFront(), so the order is wrong;
removeBack() & removeFront(): I think the two functions have the same problem.
They do not decrease the size or node of the list. Actually, they didn't remove anything;
